// NOTES
/*
 * Feel free to use this .scad in your own projects to add proper Cherry MX-styled switch cutouts to keyboards,
 * perhipherals, testers, or whatever you like. You can just copy cherry_switch_void() into your own code if you
 * like--it's entirely self-contained and reasonably small.  Just make sure to credit it, "// This module was written by
 * Riskable:" or something like that =) Actual Cherry MX Measurements: Length/Width outside dimentions: 15.5mm x 13.95mm
 * Length/Width under the overhang (no "under" on one side though): 13.95mm x 13.95mm
 * In essence, it only overhangs on two sides and the basic cherry "hole" would be 14x14mm

/* Creates the shape of a (proper) Cherry MX switch hole.
    height: The thickness, really.  Doesn't impact PLATE_THICKNESS
    x_extra: Extra (void) space on the X axis (e.g. to save some plastic). Doesn't change the top plate.
    y_extra: Extra (void) space on the Y axis.  Same thing as X.
    tolerance: Extra room on all sides (0.1 default should be good for most printers)
    plate_thickness: How thick the top plate will be. Typical Cherry MX plates are about 1.5mm thick.

/*
CHANGELOG:
    1.2: Now using utils.scad with squarish_rpoly() instead of roundedCube since it's better (it's faster *and* I wrote
it myself =). 1.1: Now using roundedCube so the interior edges aren't so sharp. 1.0: Initial release
